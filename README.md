Automated Dry Bean Seed Classification System

Objective: Developed a machine learning system for the automatic categorization of 7 distinct types of dry bean seeds using high-resolution camera-captured data.

Data Preprocessing: Utilized the Dry Bean dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository. Processed the dataset to make it suitable for model training, which included feature extraction, normalization, and splitting data into training and test sets.

Model Implementation:

Support Vector Machine (SVM): Built and tuned an SVM classifier, optimizing for accuracy and computational efficiency.
Random Forest Classifier: Implemented and fine-tuned a Random Forest model, assessing feature importance and achieving significant accuracy in seed classification.
Evaluation: Compared the performance of both SVM and Random Forest classifiers, analyzing precision, recall, and F1-score metrics to determine the optimal model for deployment.

Key Technologies: Python, Sci-kit Learn, Data Visualization Tools
